                    Here the writer will describe a place, an object, an event or maybe even a memory. But it is not just plainly describing things. The writer must paint a picture 
                    through his words. One clever way to do that is to evoke the senses of the reader. 
                    Do not only rely on sight but also involve the other senses of smell, touch, sound etc.
                    </p> A descriptive essay when done well will make the reader feel the emotions the writer was
                     feeling at the moment.
                    <p>In such an essay a writer presents a balanced study of a topic. To write such an essay, the writer must have real and extensive knowledge about the subject. There is no scope for the writerâ€™s feelings or emotions in an expository essay. It is completely based on facts, statistics, examples etc. There are sub-types here like contrast essays, cause and effect essays etc.
